# nScreeps Beta
My second screeps code now i work at this script

Action.js It contains all functions for fighting.

I think other files understandable in the name besides:

creep.js - similar functions for the creeps.

mechanic.js - upgrade ramparts.

mechanic1.js - repair roads.

transport.js - creeps who transport energy from storage to spawn and extension's.

# What need make yet:
1. Split harvester's
2. Transfer's from link to link. //finish
3. Finish logic for guard's, archer's and healer's! =)
4. If there is no transport. Scout change role. //delete scout
5. And need make tap to flag's
