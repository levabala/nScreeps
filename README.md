# nScreeps Alpha
My second screeps code now i work at this script

Action.js It contains all functions for fighting.

I think other files understandable in the name besides:

creep.js - similar functions for the creeps.

mechanic.js - upgrade ramparts.

mechanic1.js - repair roads.

transport.js - creeps who transport energy from storage to spawn and extension's.
